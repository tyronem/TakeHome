# The assignment


Starting from the Eleventy starter project ZeroPoint (https://github.com/mwdelaney/ZeroPoint) create a website that displays data from a public API (here’s a list of cool ones: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). The site should produce a “list view” of summarized items from the API and each item should have its own page with complete details.

A hint to get you going in the right direction; you’ll definitely want to use Eleventy pagination in this project. See here for details: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pagination/

Let me know if you have any questions. The above is left purposely vague to let you tackle the problem however you see fit.
